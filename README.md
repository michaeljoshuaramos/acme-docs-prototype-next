# Acme Docs

Acme Docs is a prototype documentation website, created as a personal project to enhance my frontend development skills. This project is a clone of [Increase Docs](https://increase.com/documentation), adapted to showcase and practice modern frontend technologies.

## Tech Stack

**Frontend** — I have used React + TypeScript frontend with [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling. I used [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) for the app structure and routing. 

**Cloud** — The web application is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com/).

**Collaboration** — I used Git and GitHub for version control.

## Original Inspiration

This project is based on [Increase Docs](https://increase.com/documentation), which served as the basis for building this prototype.
